= SideHopper-CSS

SideHopper-CSS is inspired by Agile Zen (https://agilezen.com)

I wanted a very clean and simple layout for a website of mine.
I feel this CSS template helps put focus on the content and not the UI.

The template is going to be tweaked for "corporate / admin" layouts instead of blogging.

It's far from finished.  I could use some help fixing IE bugs.
